# this is a Clojure-friendly emacs config

## Organization

I've tried to separate everything logically and document the purpose
of every line. [`init.el`](./init.el) acts as a kind of table of
contents.  It's a good idea to eventually go through `init.el` and the
files under the `customizations` directory so that you know exactly
what's going on.
